----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Title:** [SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24119v1)
*   **Authors:** Bo Liu, Leon Guertler, Simon Yu, Zichen Liu, Penghui Qi, Daniel Balcells, Mickel Liu, Cheston Tan, Weiyan Shi, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee, Natasha Jaques
*   **Research Problem(s):** This paper explores the use of self-play on zero-sum games to develop reasoning capabilities in language models.
*   **Key Contributions:** The authors introduce a self-play framework called SPIRAL, where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves. They also propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
*   **Keywords:** Self-Play, Zero-Sum Games, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Paper 5: Scaling Human Judgment in Community Notes with LLMs
