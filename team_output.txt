Properties\\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\\n$h_{\\\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\\\min}$ can slow down the training\\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\\\min}$ increases. Our\\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by\\nmaximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves\\ncomparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.
