        "summary": "Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,\nwhich often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense\nand unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing\ntime series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain\nlimited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual\nintuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this\npaper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms\nraw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than\nusing natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities\ndirectly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared\nsemantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer\nand more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate\nselection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the\nmost informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments\non fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that\nour approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal\nbaselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing\ntime series forecasting.

        "summary": "Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including\nin large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by\nmaximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves\ncomparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

        "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can\ndevelop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable\nrewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and\ndomain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development.",

        "summary": "This paper argues for a new paradigm for Community Notes in the LLM era: an\nopen ecosystem where both humans and LLMs can write notes, and the decision of\nwhich notes are helpful enough to show remains in the hands of humans. This\napproach can accelerate the delivery of notes, while maintaining trust and\nlegitimacy through Community Notes' foundational principle: A community of\ndiverse human raters collectively serve as the ultimate evaluator and arbiter\nof what is helpful. Further, the feedback from this diverse community can be\nused to improve LLMs' ability to produce accurate, unbiased, broadly helpful\nnotes--what we term Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF). This\nbecomes a two-way street: LLMs serve as an asset to humans--helping deliver\ncontext quickly and with minimal effort--while human feedback, in turn,\nenhances the performance of LLMs. This paper describes how such a system can\nwork, its benefits, key new risks and challenges it introduces, and a research\nagenda to solve those challenges and realize the potential of this approach.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video\ngeneration, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.\nHowever, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with\nflexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.\nThis is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint\ndistribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially\nconstructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose\nEpona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized\nspatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled\nspatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from\nfine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video\nprediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an\nend-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration\ngeneration while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to\naddress error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\\% FVD improvement and minutes\nlonger prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model\nfurther serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end\nplanners on NAVSIM benchmarks.
