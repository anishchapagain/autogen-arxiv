We then\\ntackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of\\nhyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle\\ntraining from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the\\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\\nspeeds.
