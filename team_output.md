[FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\'title\': \'Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual and Textual Perspectives\', \'authors\': [\'Dong Sixun\', \'Fan Wei\', \'Teresa Wu\', \'Fu Yanjie\'], \'summary\': \'Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,\\nwhich often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense\\nand unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing\\ntime series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain\\nlimited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual\\nintuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this\\npaper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms\\nraw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than\\nusing natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities\\ndirectly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared\\nsemantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer\\nand more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate\\nselection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the\\nmost informative variables for multivariate forecasting.
